## Responsive Web Design Certification.

This is a set of projects and assignments I am creating while earning my certification in Responsive Web Design from freeCodeCamp. They are all created strictly with HTML and CSS.

While I already have a professional background in web development, I want to stay sharp and improve my basic skill set.

Below, I have listed guided assignments and personal projects (prompts and requirements provided by FreeCodeCamp) to practice the skills learned in the assignments.

## Guided Assignments

- Balance Sheet
- Cat Painting
- CSS Colors
- Nutrition Label
- Piano
- Quiz Accessibility
- RegForm (reg = registration)

## Practice Projects

- HamForm - A user form that gathers information about the best hamburgers....one of my favorite foods :)
- Kaladin Tribute - A tribute page to Kaladin Stormblessed. Kaladin is a character from one of my favorite book series, The Stormlight Archives by Brandon Sanderson.
